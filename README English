# Ferramenta-Matlab-PlanejamentoRedesdeDistribui-o
The program was developed in MATLAB. It evaluates the effects of different configurations of a 16 node distribution grid. 

The program allows the user define variance coefficient,
the distribution grid configuration and the file with data base.

The data base should have, in the same organization, as the one in ufsc.m:

- Length of the distribution lines
- Number of consumers connected with each phase
- Load values of each phase
- Mean times to repair(MTTR) of each configuration for permanent and transitory faults.

The program uses the continuos Markov chain to map the state of the components,
and calculates the down and up times. 
The simulator goes on till every component reachs one year of simulation.
With disponibility indexes, its possible to calculate the costs year-by-year,
due to transitory and permanent faults.
To do that all the equipments were modeled.
